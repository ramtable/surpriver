# Surpriver - Find High Moving Stocks before they Move
Find high moving stocks before they move using anomaly detection and machine learning. Surpriver uses machine learning to look at volume + price action and infer unusual patterns which can result in big moves in stocks.

### Files Description
| Path | Description
| :--- | :----------
| surpriver | Main folder.
| &boxur;&nbsp; dictionaries | Folder to save data dictionaries for later use. 
| &boxur;&nbsp; figures | Figures for this github repositories.
| &boxur;&nbsp; stocks | List of all the stocks that you want to analyze.
| data_loader.py | Module for loading data from yahoo finance.
| detection_engine.py | Main module for running anomaly detection on data and finding stocks with most unusual price and volume patterns.
| feature_generator.py | Generates price and volume return features as well as plenty of technical indicators.

## Usage

You will need to install the following package to train and test the models.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

### Predictions
If you want to go ahead and directly get the most anomalous stocks for today, you can simple run the following command to get the stocks with the most unusual patterns. We will dive deeper into the command in the following sections.

```
python detection_engine.py --is_test 0 --future_bars 25 --top_n 25 --min_volume 5000 --data_granularity_minutes 60 --history_to_use 14 --is_load_from_dictionary 1 --data_dictionary_path 'dictionaries/feature_dict_2.npy' --is_save_dictionary 0
```
